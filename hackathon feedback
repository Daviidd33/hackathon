Quiz Game.
First of all I absolutly love the comments between code lines in your javascript!
It really helps understand the code and especially if you will work in a team in the future.
You showed your knowlege in DOM manipulation, array methods and conditionals.
The game is functional and works as intended so great job!
I would put a bit more effort in the styling to make it look a little more modern.
Maybe when you get a question wrong after checking the answers you can do reset quiz option instead of trying 
again on the same quiz. Maybe show questions one by one and not in a list. But all of these things are minor and
not so important as you overall did a great job.
Very good David!
